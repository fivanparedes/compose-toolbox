# Compose Toolbox 
A set of docker-compose files to help me in local development with several projects in my work. With the advantage of volumes, I use containers to run anything without install it in the host O.S.

## What's included

- Two Laravel Apps: a docker-compose file to serve two identical Laravel apps on PHP 7.4.
- Python Runner: a docker-compose file to run any Python script anywhere.
